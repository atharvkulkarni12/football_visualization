# football_visualization
Starting with data visualization of features and explanatory data analysis on the dataset. Top players
based on wage, overall rating, potential was identified. Bivariate analysis on feature was performed
using data visualisation. Dependency of wage on home country was plotted and nations with most
paid players were identified. Inferences : If home country falls in Europe/Latin America, chances of
getting high wages are more.
In bivariate analysis, it was found that average wage increases exponentially with increment in
rating(overall). Clubs paying maximum wages were identified. The dependency of physical attributes
with age can be visualised. Clubs were clustered as per the sum of wages. Attempt was made to
visualise the difference in Potential and overall rating of players and a comparison of overall and
potential rating of top playersâ€™ (wage wise) was visualised.
